# Render Wright

So I have been interested in computer graphics for quite some time now and for the most part it has been a hobby of mine to render things. 
Recently I decided that I would learn how to be a computer graphics programmer to the fullest extent. Which means that I will be completely learning
how to use a graphics API (OpenGL and Vulkan). I have used OpenGL in the past, but I have never mastered the API, but this will be the repository where
I do just that. Below is a list of things that I'm looking to accomplish on my journey to be comming a successful graphics programmer so stick around 
and watch me check off each of them! [Original Inspiration] (http://www.gamasutra.com/blogs/OliverFranzke/20140718/221347/How_to_become_a_Graphics_Programmer_in_the_games_industry.php)
