# Render Wright

So I have been interested in computer graphics for quite some time now and for the most part it has been a hobby of mine to render things. 
Recently I decided that I would learn how to be a computer graphics programmer to the fullest extent. Which means that I will be completely learning
how to use a graphics API (OpenGL and Vulkan). I have used OpenGL in the past, but I have never mastered the API, but this will be the repository where
I do just that. Below is a list of things that I'm looking to accomplish on my journey to be comming a successful graphics programmer so stick around 
and watch me check off each of them! [Original Inspiration] (http://www.gamasutra.com/blogs/OliverFranzke/20140718/221347/How_to_become_a_Graphics_Programmer_in_the_games_industry.php)

# Render ideas to implement

* [] A solar system with multiple astroid fields(Instance Rendered)
* [] Ray tracing on the GPU in with / without compute shaders
* [] A volume rendering example
* [] Octree visualizations

# Render Engine Ideas

* [] Profiling every aspect(Removed on release)
* [] Exception handling
* [] Scene loading with Open Game Engine Exchange Specification
* [] Occulusion Queries when triangles under threshold
* [] Shadows(soft and volumetric)
* [] Collision detection(Octrees)
* [] Physics systems(Havoc, Nvidia Physics ? )
* [] Deferred Rendering
* [] Animations
* [] Particle systems built in
* [] Scripting Language of some sort(typescript, javascript, C#)
* [] Voxel rendering effects
* [] Motion blur capabiltities
* [] HDR lighting
* [] Terrian generation
* [] Cloth support
* [] Depth based Tesselation
* [] Debug mode vs Game mode
* [] Editor
* [] Ability to port natively to different platforms(Android, WebGL, PC)
* [] Ray tracing scenes for video trailers
